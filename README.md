# Miscellaneous Pico Projects

Repository includes code for miscellaneous C-based Raspberry Pi Pico projects I have created in exploring embedded development.

Assumes CMake and GNU Arm Embedded toolchain compatible with Pico SDK v1.3.0+ already installed. FreeRTOS Kernel and Raspberry Pi Pico (and consequently TinyUSB) are submodules of the project.
